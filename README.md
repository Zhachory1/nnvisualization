Visualization of Common ML Algorithms

I will be using deeplearn.js to do most of the math computing. I will use d3.js
or three.js to visualize the components/show an example for it. I will have a
python server grabbing the web resources and I will have it host an API to grab
the training, test, and validation sets for the different NNs.

## Algorithms
I will be demonstrating a few basic machine learning algorithms
 * Linear Regression
    * Obviously house prices would be wonderful
 * k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
    * Movie Recommendation System
 * Decision Trees and Random Trees
    * Puppy classifier
 * Naive Bayes (or Bayesian belief network, cause I think it's fun)
    * Text Classification would be good here
 * k-Means Clustering/Hierarchial Clustering/Label Propagation
    * Similar movies from the IMDB database
 * CNN
    * MNIST
 * RNN (maybe LSTM)
    * Sentiment Analysis
 * DQN
    * OpenAI
 * Genetic algorithm
    * Self-driving behavior
